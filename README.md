# Calculator
Command line calculator

The program was compiled using windows machine and Visual Studio Code.
To open the application go to Calculator\build\Debug and open Calculator.exe

There were problems compiling the gtest, so I created a separate folder with self-contained build system,
and at the moment I think everything is fine with it.

I used Cmake for the build configuration. If you want to load and open the project, I think Cmake should reparse and configure it again. 

Iâ€™m adding a few photos of the app.
